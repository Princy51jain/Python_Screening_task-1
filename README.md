# Workshop Booking – UI/UX Enhanced Version 🎨

This is an enhanced version of the **Workshop Booking** Django project.  
The core functionality of the original project remains intact, but I focused on **UI and UX improvements** to make the platform more user-friendly, modern, and visually consistent.

## 🚀 Features Added / Enhanced
- Improved **navigation bar** with responsive design.
- Clean and consistent **color scheme** and **typography**.
- Modernized **forms** (login, register, profile update, etc.) with better spacing and alignment.
- Redesigned **dashboard and workshop pages** for clarity.
- Added **mobile responsiveness** for smoother use on smaller devices.
- Enhanced **error and success messages** for better user feedback.
